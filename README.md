# 1\. Google Calendar_Сalculates a person’s age.gs :underage:
*Google Apps Script [Google Calendar_Сalculates a person’s age.gs](/Google%20Calendar_%D0%A1alculates%20a%20person%E2%80%99s%20age.gs) which creates events (birthdays and anniversaries), indicating the past years in the calendar.*

As a user of an Android phone, I was not always happy with the fact that my calendar displayed the birthdays of contacts without indicating the age of a person. The same situation was with the anniversaries of contacts - there seems to be an anniversary, but it is not clear how much time has passed since this event. Looking through the contact’s details, finding the year of birth or the date of the anniversary, and then counting on something - there has never been time for this. I decided to simplify my life and wrote Google Apps Script, which first searches for these events in a special calendar that displays these events by default. And then, in the second step, it calculates the age for specific contacts and creates events in the main calendar. This script was published on the [Google Sheets Telegram channel (in Russian)](https://t.me/google_sheets/365).

# 2\. Google Calendar_Months and years of a baby, monthly reminder.gs :baby:
*Скрипт Google Apps Script [Months and years of a baby, monthly reminder.gs](/Google%20Calendar_Months%20and%20years%20of%20a%20baby%2C%20monthly%20reminder.gs) is great for all young fathers - it shows how many months and years the child is old, with a monthly reminder.*

This is a code that makes life easier for young fathers - because while all the grandmothers perfectly remember their grandson’s/granddaughter’s birthday and congratulate on this event every month - I could not keep it in my memory. I decided to slightly automate the process and at the same time figure out how to work with dates in Google Apps Script. And of course, to make this reminder appear in advance, and not on the baby’s birthday! This script was published on the [Google Sheets Telegram channel (in Russian)](https://t.me/google_sheets/435).
