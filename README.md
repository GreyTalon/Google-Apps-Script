# Google Calendar_Birthdays.gs :underage:

*[Google Apps Script Google Calendar_Birthdays.gs](Google%20Calendar_Birthdays.gs) that creates events (birthdays and anniversaries), indicating the past years in the calendar.*

As a user of an Android phone, I was not always happy with the fact that my calendar displayed the birthdays of contacts without indicating the age of a person. The same situation was with the anniversaries of contacts - there seems to be an anniversary, but it is not clear how many years the anniversary is for. Looking through your contacts' details, finding the year of birth or the date of the anniversary, and then figuring the math - there has never been time for this. I decided to simplify my life and wrote a Google Apps Script, which first, searches for these events in a special calendar that displays these events by default. And then, in the second step, it calculates the age for specific contacts and creates events in the main calendar. This script was published on the [Google Sheets Telegram channel (in Russian)](https://t.me/google_sheets/365).

# Google Calendar_A child’s age in months and years, with a monthly reminder.gs :baby:

*[Google Apps Script](Google%20Calendar_A%20child’s%20age_v1.gs) is great for all young fathers - it shows how many months and years the child is old, with a monthly reminder.*

This is a code that makes life easier for young fathers - because while all the grandmothers perfectly remember their grandson’s/granddaughter’s birthday and congratulate on this event every month - I could not keep it in my memory. I decided to slightly automate the process and at the same time figure out how to work with dates in Google Apps Script. And of course, to make this reminder appear in advance, and not on the baby’s birthday! This script was published on the [Google Sheets Telegram channel (in Russian)](https://t.me/google_sheets/435).
